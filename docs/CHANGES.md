## Asyncio Refactoring

### Overview

The codebase has been refactored to use asyncio instead of threading for better performance, resource utilization, and concurrency management. This change affects several key components:

- **Server Manager**: Created a new `AsyncServerManager` class for asynchronous SSH operations
- **Proxy Manager**: Refactored to use async methods for deployment operations
- **Background Tasks**: Updated to use a single event loop for all async operations
- **Routes**: Updated to support async operations with proper error handling

### Key Components

#### AsyncServerManager

A new module `async_server_manager.py` has been created to handle SSH connections asynchronously:

```python
# Example usage
from modules.async_server_manager import AsyncServerManager

# Execute a command asynchronously
result = await AsyncServerManager.execute_command(server, "nginx -t")

# Upload a file asynchronously
success = await AsyncServerManager.upload_string_to_file(server, content, "/path/to/file")
```

#### Proxy Manager

The `ProxyManager` class has been updated to include async methods:

```python
# Example usage
from modules.proxy_manager import ProxyManager

proxy_manager = ProxyManager()
success = await proxy_manager.async_deploy_proxy_config(server_id, domain_id)
```

#### Background Tasks

The `BackgroundTasks` class in `tasks.py` has been refactored to use a single event loop for all async operations:

```python
# Example of how background tasks now work
background_tasks._run_async_task(some_async_coroutine())
```

## Resource Management Improvements

### Connection Pooling

The `AsyncServerManager` implements connection pooling to reuse SSH connections:

```python
# Connection pool is managed internally
CONNECTION_POOL = {}  # server_id -> connection

# Connections are automatically reused when possible
conn = await AsyncServerManager.get_ssh_connection(server)
```

### Resource Cleanup

Proper cleanup of resources is now implemented:

- SSH connections are properly closed when no longer needed
- A cleanup function is registered with `atexit` to ensure connections are closed on application shutdown
- Temporary files are properly managed and cleaned up

## Error Handling Enhancements

### Retry Utilities

A new module `retry_utils.py` has been created to provide robust retry functionality:

```python
# Example usage for async functions
from modules.retry_utils import async_retry

result = await async_retry(
    some_async_function,
    arg1, arg2,
    max_attempts=3,
    retry_delay=2.0,
    backoff_factor=1.5,
    exceptions=ConnectionError
)

# Example usage for sync functions
from modules.retry_utils import retry

result = retry(
    some_function,
    arg1, arg2,
    max_attempts=3,
    retry_delay=2.0,
    backoff_factor=1.5,
    exceptions=ConnectionError
)
```

### Consistent Error Handling

Error handling has been standardized across the codebase:

- All async operations include proper try/except blocks
- Errors are logged with appropriate context
- User-facing error messages are consistent and informative

## Security Improvements

### Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration has been moved to environment variables:

- Encryption keys are now loaded from `.env` file
- A `.env.example` file is provided as a template
- The `config.py` module has been updated to load environment variables

```python
# Example .env file
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-encryption-key-should-be-changed-in-production
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-key-should-be-changed-in-production
```

### Secure Credential Management

Credentials are now handled more securely:

- SSH keys and passwords are not stored in memory longer than necessary
- Encryption key is loaded from environment variables
- Sensitive data is properly encrypted and decrypted

## Testing

### Test Script

A comprehensive test script has been created to verify the asyncio refactoring:

```bash
# Run the test script
python tests/test_async_refactoring.py
```

The test script covers:

- AsyncServerManager functionality
- ProxyManager async methods
- Retry utilities
- Event loop management

## Environment Setup

### Setup Script

A setup script has been created to initialize the environment:

```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

The setup script:

- Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Creates a `.env` file from `.env.example` if it doesn't exist
- Checks database configuration
- Sets execute permissions for scripts

### Dependencies

The following new dependencies have been added:

- `asyncssh>=2.13.2`: For async SSH operations
- `aiohttp>=3.9.1`: For async HTTP requests
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`: For loading environment variables

## Migration Guide

### Updating Existing Code

If you have custom code that interacts with the refactored components, you'll need to update it:

1. Replace `ServerManager` with `AsyncServerManager` for SSH operations
2. Use `async/await` syntax for async methods
3. Update error handling to catch specific exceptions
4. Use the retry utilities for operations that may fail temporarily

### Configuration Changes

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. Set a secure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file
3. Update any scripts that rely on the old configuration format

## Conclusion

These changes significantly improve the stability, security, and performance of the Reverse Proxy Control Center v4. The asyncio refactoring reduces resource usage and improves responsiveness, while the error handling enhancements make the application more robust.
